      <h1>Hi, I'm Max.</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a software developer based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, with 10+ years
        of experience building enterprise web applications. I focus on creating
        scalable, high-quality solutions for businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thrive in collaborative teams, where I enjoy mentoring junior
        developers and learning from senior colleagues. Continuous learning and
        knowledge sharing are central to my approach, helping to build stronger,
        more effective teams.
